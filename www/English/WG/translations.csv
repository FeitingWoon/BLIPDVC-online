longText;" This questionnaire is a Polish adaptation of the American inventory for the study of speech development in the youngest children (MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory). This method is based on parents' knowledge of their children's linguistic development and concerns speech understanding, speaking and communication using gestures. Much of the inventory consists of questions about the earliest vocabulary of children. Parents are asked to mark the words the child understands as well as those used in speech. To complete the questionnaire correctly, you should read the questions and listen to what your child is saying for a few days. He should not be questioned or asked to repeat individual words, nor should he ""teach words"". It is enough for the parents to answer the questions according to their knowledge about the child."; understanding; none

longText;"On the following pages we present a list of common words known to young children. For those words that your child understands but does not yet say them, please put a stamp in the first column (R = understand). For those words that your child does not only understand understands, but also says the same, please put a stamp in the second column (M = understands and speaks). If the child uses a slightly different form, e.g. dog says, not dog, please put a stamp next to the word dog. , if the child pronounces a word differently (e.g. a lyb instead of a fish or a string instead of a squirrel). Please also mark such a word with a plus, you can also enter the wording in the form in which the child uses it. Sometimes children make up their own words, e.g. today instead of a ball; also such a form should be treated as a word and the word ""ball"" should be marked, additionally entering ""y."" mark the appropriate item and add the appropriate phrase. Any doubts can be added on the questionnaire.
