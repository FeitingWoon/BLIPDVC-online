# CDI online
In order to launch any inventory you have to provide a proper URL query eg. /?id=test&form=wg&lang=pl&type=static
Currently accesible langs and forms are in the www folder. Id could be any string, ids of length 21 mean a person connected with the StarWords app.

## Changes
### v1.0
* Added: Default setting (static) for type parameter (issue #164)
* Fixed: Cleaned code for adaptive inventory (issue #162)
* Fixed: End message in CAT before opportunity to give a comment to a last part (issue #168)
* Fixed: Long waiting after confirmation of the last part in the static inventory (issue #110)

last deploy (cdi dev): 16.11.2021 no version tag
